### _[Salesforce Mentor - Build Together](https://courses.salesforcementor.com/p/build-together/)_

A month-long project you build on a team of 2-3 with other learning Salesforce developers. Small groups will work together to complete development assignments. A weekly meeting with experienced developers to go over questions and review code. Get hands-on experience by working on projects in a team with requirements.

## Overview
Build a Todo list application synced to the task object using Salesforce Lightning Web Components and Apex.
- Understanding the basics of Salesforce Lightning components and architecture.
- Building basic Lightning Web Component (LWC)
- Implementing data binding and event handling in LWCs
- Creating UI components using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Integrating LWCs with Salesforce data using Apex
- Debugging and troubleshooting LWCs
- Best practices for designing and building reusable LWCs
- Deploying and testing LWCs in a Salesforce environment
- Integrating LWCs into Salesforce pages like Lightning Record Pages or Community pages.

## Project Requirements  
- Create an LWC todo list that can support the basic CRUD commands
- Sync the todo list with the tasks standard object
- Use LWC standard component or SLDS for styling

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository onto your local computer and open the folder in Visual Studio Code
- Create a branch from the main branch for your team or individually
  - (ADVANCED) Create a subbranch for each week and merge that into the main team branch
- Connect to your playground org and start coding!

## Development Requirements
- Must use SFDX, git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code, **NO DEVELOPER CONSOLE!**
- Your code should be able to run in any playground org via a GitHub repo
- Must be able to commit to meeting weekly with a large group

## Notes
- Build Together is meant to be challenging. You will be asked to figure things out with your team. Sr. Dev will guide you but not fully outline what you should be doing. Asking questions is the more important thing.
- You can use other resources but donâ€™t copy it word for word. You should be able to explain what your code is doing.
- Team members are meant to keep each other accountable, but if a team member is not pulling their weight, they will be cut.
